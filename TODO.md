- icons for supported platforms
	- forms could be a platform on its own (though some forms libs are not avail for avail platforms)

- merge some sections with tags (or images) (#Reactive -> Rx tag, applied to all compatible libs)
	- this will avoid dupes, also for #Forms, some libs are not forms only)

- tag/image for commercial vs opensource
	- or only link OS stuff ?

- use node to compile (add stars and verify links)

- automate contributors inclusion
